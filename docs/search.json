    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project aims to produce a comprehensive analysis of global carbon emissions through identifying countries that contribute to the emissions and examining the factors that drive these trends. Carbon emissions are one of the leading causes of climate change and global warming which are some of the pressing environmental challenges currently. We seek to answer critical questions about the sources and patterns of anthropogenic carbon emissions, investigating how energy consumption, trade, air quality, deforestation, and economic development contribute to the overall emissions of different nations over a range of twenty years.\nOur goal is to provide valuable insights that can guide policy makers, researchers, and environmental scientists in their efforts to address the climate crisis. Hopefully, the findings of this analysis will help us better understand the requirement for targeted policies to reduce carbon footprints, promote sustainable energy alternatives, and implement regulatory measures that can limit the environmental impact of high-emission nations.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Data Sources\nWebsite: The World Bank Group\nTo analyze country-wise CO2 emissions, various metrics that influence and correlate with CO2 release have been considered. The dataset includes information on forest area percentage, fossil fuel consumption percentage, trade metrics (imports and exports), livestock production, and air pollution levels. Additionally, data on countries’ income levels, GDP, and renewable energy usage has been gathered to examine the factors and trends contributing to CO2 emissions.\nThe raw data from the World Bank Group website was downloaded as CSV files.\nData Links and Collection:\n\nCO2 Emissions (megatonnes)\nForest Area (% of land area)\nFossil Fuel Energy Consumption (% of total energy consumption by country)\nImports of Goods and Services (US dollars)\nExports of Goods and Services (US dollars)\nLivestock Production Index (Baseline Index: 100)\nAir Pollution (micrograms/m3)\nGDP (US dollars)\nRenewable Energy Consumption (% of total energy consumption by country)\nIncome Level: Obtained from the zip folder as a separate CSV file after downloading the data (Low, Lower middle, Upper middle, High)\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Format\n\nCarbon Emissions: A measure of annual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in megatonnes, one of the six Kyoto greenhouse gases (GHG) from 1970 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nForest Area: An annual percentage metric of forest area land, excluding agricultural production systems, from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nFossil Fuel Energy Consumption: An annual percentage metric of Fossil fuel (comprises coal, oil, petroleum, and natural gas products) consumption from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nImports of Goods and Services: An annual measure of goods and services transacted between residents of a country and the rest of the world in US dollars from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nExports of Goods and Services: An annual measure of goods exports, service exports and primary income receipts in US dollars from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nLivestock Production Index: An annual measure of the Livestock production index that includes meat and milk from all sources, dairy products such as cheese, and eggs, honey, raw silk, wool, and hides and skins from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nAir Pollution: A measure of the mean annual exposure (micrograms per cubic meter) of a nation’s population to concentrations of suspended particles measuring less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter, which are capable of causing severe health damage. Data has been collected from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nGDP: The annual gross domestic product in US dollars from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: The share of renewables energy in total final energy consumption measured by the percentage of total energy consumption from 1960 to 2023 for 266 countries and regions. The dataset contains Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and the Years.\nIncome Level: A dataset indicating the income level of countries as High, Low, Upper Middle, and Lower Middle income for 265 countries and regions. The dataset contains the Conutry Code, Region, Income Group, Special Notes and Table Name.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Preprocessing\nAfter importing the data:\n\nThe columns are filtered to only include data from years 1990 - 2020\nThe data frames are converted to long format\nAll metrics data frames are joined on ‘Country Codes’ to obtain the final dataset\nThe data frame is exported as a CSV file\n\nLink to Preprocessing script on Python",
