    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project aims to produce a comprehensive analysis of global carbon emissions through identifying countries that contribute to the emissions and examining the factors that drive these trends. Carbon emissions are one of the leading causes of climate change and global warming which are some of the pressing environmental challenges currently. We seek to answer critical questions about the sources and patterns of anthropogenic carbon emissions, investigating how energy consumption, trade, air quality, deforestation, and economic development contribute to the overall emissions of different nations over a range of twenty years.\nOur goal is to provide valuable insights that can guide policy makers, researchers, and environmental scientists in their efforts to address the climate crisis. Hopefully, the findings of this analysis will help us better understand the requirement for targeted policies to reduce carbon footprints, promote sustainable energy alternatives, and implement regulatory measures that can limit the environmental impact of high-emission nations.",

It shows that South Sudan tops the chart with the highest number of missing values which is slightly above 150. There is a noticeable drop after the first four countries. Countries such as Tuvalu, Grenada, Maldives, and Sao Tome have the fewest missing values among the top 15 but still show a notable amount of missing data.\nThe missing data from these countries could stem from a lack of infrastructure to measure, collect, or report the data effectively. Additionally, inconsistencies may arise due to the use of different methodologies or units of measurement, which could result in data being recorded as missing. In the data analysis section of the project, the correlation between these countries’ high levels of missing data and their real impact on global carbon emissions will be examined.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\nemission_data_missing &lt;- emission_data[!complete.cases(emission_data), ]\nplot_missing(emission_data_missing, max_cols = 8, num_char = 3, percent = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values Pattern Analysis\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 2, vjust = 33.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph explains the different patterns of missing data among the metrics on which CO2 emissions depend on. It also quantifies these patterns and the number of missing rows for each metric using a bar plot.\nFrom the middle graph, we can observe that the pattern where only Fossil Fuels Consumption data is missing while all other data is available is the most frequent with more than 1500 occurrences. This could be because some countries do not have the infrastructure to record this metric or do not report their fossil fuel energy consumption. This fact is also confirmed by the bar plot above which shows that the Fossil Fuels Consumption feature has the most amount of missing values. The second most common pattern with a frequency of almost 500 is the Fossil Fuels Consumption, Imports and Exports data missing while all other features’ data is available. The rest of the patterns have a frequency less than 200.",

In all facets, we observe the same order of CO2 emission amounts with Asia having the highest amount due to the continent have the most number of countries, and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) having the least amount. The amount of CO2 emissions in Asia steadily increased each decade and reached an alarming 200k megatonnes, which indicates that Asia plays a huge role in pollution. However, the amount of CO2 emissions in Europe decreased over each decade, having its highest emissions in 1990-2000. This shows a slow down in CO2 emission activity in this continent. The amount of CO2 emissions in Africa slightly increased each decade, while they remained almost the same in the Americas and Oceania from 1990-2020.\n\n\n3.0.2 Biplot to understand relationships between contributing factors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\n\nemissions_df_g2 &lt;- emissions_df\nemissions_df_g2[is.na(emissions_df)] &lt;- 0\ndraw_biplot(emissions_df_g2, points = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Biplot of CO\"[2] ~ \"Emissions Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the biplot above we can analyze the relationship of different features that contribute to CO2 emissions. We can observe that Imports, Exports and GDP are highly correlated to the amount of CO2 emissions, while Fossil Fuel Consumption shows a positive correlation. Livestock Production is almost at a 90 degrees angle to the CO2 emissions vector and therefore we can say that there is no correlation between the two. Features such as Air Pollution and Renewable Energy have a negative correlation. Air pollution having a negative correlation could be due to the fact that air pollutants are made up of more than just CO2, air pollutants also include sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, etc. which have significantly reduced over the years.\n\n\n3.0.3 Analyzing the Trend of CO2 Emissions and Forest Area over 30 Years\n\n\nCode\n# Countries in the Amazon Rainforest: Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname\n# Source: https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/amazon-rainforest/\n\namazon_countries &lt;- c(\"BRA\", \"PER\", \"BOL\", \"ECU\", \"COL\", \"VEN\", \"GUF\", \"GUY\", \"SUR\")\n\nemissions_df_amazon &lt;- emissions_df|&gt; \n  filter(Country.Code %in% amazon_countries)\n\n# We do not have data for French Guiana so we will go ahead and account for the rest of the 8 countries in the Amazon Rainforest\n# The filtered dataset does not have missing values for Forest Area and CO2 Emissions\n\n# aggregating CO2 emissions and Forest Area by Year\naggregated_data &lt;- emissions_df_amazon |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Total_CO2 = sum(CO2_Emissions),\n    Total_Forest_Area = sum(Forest_Area)\n  )\n\n# Scaling the data\naggregated_data &lt;- aggregated_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Scaled_CO2 = (Total_CO2 - min(Total_CO2)) / (max(Total_CO2) - min(Total_CO2)),\n    Scaled_Forest_Area = (Total_Forest_Area - min(Total_Forest_Area)) / (max(Total_Forest_Area) - min(Total_Forest_Area))\n  )\n\nggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = Year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Scaled_CO2, color = \"CO2 Emissions (Mt)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Scaled_Forest_Area, color = \"Forest Area (%)\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"CO2 Emissions (Mt)\" = \"red\", \"Forest Area (%)\" = \"#228B22\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"CO\"[2] ~ \"Emissions and Forest Area Trend in the Amazon Rainforest (1990-2020)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Scaled Values\",\n    color = \"Legend\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this graph we wanted to investigate how the Amazon Rainforest has been impacted by deforestation and other human activities, and if this has impacted the CO2 emissions in the rainforest. Using the visualization above, we notice a clear trend of forest area dramatically reducing and CO2 emissions steadily increasing (with the exception of years 2015-2020). This confirms the fact that the depletion of the Amazon rainforest, one of the largest carbon sinks in the world has caused an increase in CO2 emissions, with the highest emissions being released in 2014.\n\n\n3.0.4 Determining if Livestock Production Contributes to CO2 emissions\nThe effect of livestock production on CO2 emissions is currently being studied and debated. We have investigated this topic using the graph below Source: https://sentientmedia.org/how-does-livestock-affect-climate-change/\n\n\nCode\n# Aggregating CO2 Emissions and Livestock Production by Country\nemissions_df_livestock &lt;- emissions_df |&gt;\n  group_by(Country.Name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Total_CO2 = sum(CO2_Emissions),\n    Total_Livestock = sum(Livestock_Production)\n  )\n\nemissions_df_livestock &lt;- na.omit(emissions_df_livestock)\n\n# Obtaining the top 3 and bottom 3 countries in accordance with livestock production\nsorted_emissions &lt;- emissions_df_livestock |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Total_Livestock))\n\ntop_3_countries &lt;- sorted_emissions |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\nbottom_3_countries &lt;- sorted_emissions |&gt;\n  slice_tail(n = 3)\n\ncombined_df &lt;- bind_rows(top_3_countries |&gt; mutate(Group = \"Countries with Highest Production\"),\n                         bottom_3_countries |&gt; mutate(Group = \"Countries with Lowest Production\"))\n\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = Total_Livestock, y = Total_CO2, color = Group)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Country.Name), vjust = -1, size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Countries with Highest Production\" = \"darkgreen\", \"Countries with Lowest Production\" = \"darkorange\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"CO\"[2] ~ \"Emissions over Countries with Lowest and Highest Livestock Production\",\n    x = \"Total Livestock Production\",\n    y = \"Total CO2 Emissions (Mt)\",\n    color = \"Group\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have visualized the emissions of the countries with lowest and highest livestock production and observe that there is no clear relationship between CO2 emissions and livestock production. Countries with the highest livestock production (St. Kitts and Nevis & Antigua and Barbuda) have the lowest emissions. Countries with the lowest livestock production have higher emissions. Kuwait which has livestock production on the lower end is observed to have the highest emissions. The absence of a clear correlation could be because livestock production activities mainly release a substantial amount of methane as a pollutant as compared to CO2.\n\n\n3.0.5 Analyzing the Trend of CO2 Emissions and Fossil Fuel Consumption over 30 Years\n\n\nCode\nemissions_df_fuel &lt;- emissions_df\n\nemissions_df_fuel &lt;- emissions_df_fuel[complete.cases(emissions_df_fuel[c(\"CO2_Emissions\", \"Fossil_Fuel_Energy\")]), ]\n\naggregated_data &lt;- emissions_df_fuel |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Total_CO2 = sum(CO2_Emissions),\n    Total_Fuel = sum(Fossil_Fuel_Energy)\n  )\n\naggregated_data &lt;- aggregated_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Scaled_CO2 = (Total_CO2 - min(Total_CO2)) / (max(Total_CO2) - min(Total_CO2)),\n    Scaled_Fuel = (Total_Fuel - min(Total_Fuel)) / (max(Total_Fuel) - min(Total_Fuel))\n  )\n\nggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = Year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Scaled_CO2, color = \"CO2 Emissions (Mt)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Scaled_Fuel, color = \"Fossil Fuel Energy Consumption (%)\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"CO2 Emissions (Mt)\" = \"red\", \"Fossil Fuel Energy Consumption (%)\" = \"black\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Worldwide CO\"[2] ~ \"Emissions and Fossil Fuel Consumption Trend (1990-2015)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Scaled Values\",\n    color = \"Legend\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values for 2016-2020 are missing for fossil fuel consumption, hence this analysis is done for the years 1990-2015. From the graph above, we can see the fossil fuel consumption remains almost constant throughout the years (on the higher end) and the CO2 emissions steadily increase reflecting the rising global energy demand. Fossil fuels remain as the primary source of energy from 1990 to present and have contributed to increase in global CO2 emissions. The drop in values in 2015 is due to scaling and represents that both CO2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption were the lowest in this year.",
