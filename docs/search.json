    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project aims to produce a comprehensive analysis of global carbon emissions through identifying countries that contribute to the emissions and examining the factors that drive these trends. Carbon emissions are one of the leading causes of climate change and global warming which are some of the pressing environmental challenges currently. We seek to answer critical questions about the sources and patterns of anthropogenic carbon emissions, investigating how energy consumption, trade, air quality, deforestation, and economic development contribute to the overall emissions of different nations over a range of thirty years.\nOur goal is to provide valuable insights that can guide policy makers, researchers, and environmental scientists in their efforts to address the climate crisis. We hope the findings of this analysis will help us better understand the requirement for targeted policies to reduce carbon footprints, promote sustainable energy alternatives, and implement regulatory measures that can limit the environmental impact of high-emission nations.",

It shows that South Sudan tops the chart with the highest number of missing values which is slightly above 150. There is a noticeable drop after the first four countries. Countries such as Tuvalu, Grenada, Maldives, and Sao Tome have the fewest missing values among the top 15 but still show a notable amount of missing data.\nThe missing data from these countries could stem from a lack of infrastructure to measure, collect, or report the data effectively. Additionally, inconsistencies may arise due to the use of different methodologies or units of measurement, which could result in data being recorded as missing. In the data analysis section of the project, the correlation between these countries’ high levels of missing data and their real impact on global carbon emissions will be examined.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\nemission_data_missing &lt;- emission_data[!complete.cases(emission_data), ]\nplot_missing(emission_data_missing, max_cols = 8, num_char = 3, percent = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values Pattern Analysis\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 2, vjust = 33.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph explains the different patterns of missing data among the metrics on which CO2 emissions depend on. It also quantifies these patterns and the number of missing rows for each metric using a bar plot.\nFrom the middle graph, we can observe that the pattern where only Fossil Fuels Consumption data is missing while all other data is available is the most frequent with more than 1500 occurrences. This could be because some countries do not have the infrastructure to record this metric or do not report their fossil fuel energy consumption. This fact is also confirmed by the bar plot above which shows that the Fossil Fuels Consumption feature has the most amount of missing values. The second most common pattern with a frequency of almost 500 is the Fossil Fuels Consumption, Imports and Exports data missing while all other features’ data is available. The rest of the patterns have a frequency less than 200.",

The graph corroborates the well-established trend of increasing CO2 emissions over the past three decades. There are many factors that contribute to the rise in C02 emissions like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, or supply chain emissions, which are further investigated in this analysis.\nThere is sharper increase of C02 emissions between 2003 to 2013. This could be due to the rapid industrialization and economic growth in developing nations, particularly China and India, which led to increased energy consumption. These significant investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and urbanization in emerging economies increased the demand for energy, much of which was sourced from fossil fuels.\nA notable exception to this trend occurred in 2020, when global CO2 emissions decreased by approximately 5% due to widespread lockdowns and economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The perceptual color gradient indicates the relative increase in emissions across different regions. Countries with darker colors or shades have higher carbon emissions than countries colored in lighter shades. Some countries are unaccounted as they do not measure or report their carbon emissions data to the United Nations and they are depicted in grey color.\nIt can be observed that China is the leading nation of carbon emissions followed by the US. China has been a global manufacturing powerhouse in the past few decades, which is the reason it consumes vast amounts of energy. The US has a long history of industrialization and energy-intensive lifestyles, resulting to its significant cumulative emissions.\nIt’s worth noting that Antarctica, depicted in gray, accurately reflects the absence of significant human activity and, consequently, negligible carbon emissions. As carbon emissions are primarily a result of human activities, regions with minimal human population, such as Antarctica, have minimal impact on global emissions.",

The amount of CO2 emissions in Asia steadily increased each decade and reached an alarming 200k megatonnes, which indicates that Asia plays a huge role in pollution. However, the amount of CO2 emissions in Europe decreased over each decade, having its highest emissions in 1990-2000. This shows a slow down in CO2 emission activity in this continent. The amount of CO2 emissions in Africa slightly increased each decade, while they remained almost the same in the Americas and Oceania from 1990-2020.",

Livestock Production is almost at a 90 degrees angle to the CO2 emissions vector and therefore we can say that there is no correlation between the two. Features such as Air Pollution and Renewable Energy have a negative correlation. Air pollution having a negative correlation could be due to the fact that air pollutants are made up of more than just CO2, air pollutants also include sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, etc. which have significantly reduced over the years.",

Both panels exhibit a strong positive correlation between the amount of goods exported/imported and CO2 emissions. This means as the volume of goods increases, carbon emissions also rise. However, the trend is non-linear, suggesting that the rate of increase in CO₂ emissions accelerates as the volume of goods grows.\nExports show a more exponential growth in emissions at higher levels. This is possibly due to energy-intensive production or transportation processes for the exporting of goods. The increase in emissions with imports is steadier and slightly less steep compared to exports. This suggests that importing may involve less direct emission-intensive activities, likely because the carbon cost of production occurs elsewhere. In both panels, the confidence intervals (the shaded regions around the trend lines) are narrow at lower volumes and widen slightly at higher volumes, indicating higher variability in emissions for larger trade activities.",

From the graph above, we can see the fossil fuel consumption remains almost constant throughout the years (on the higher end) and the CO2 emissions steadily increase reflecting the rising global energy demand. The steep drop in values in 2015 is due to the fact that China significantly reduced coal usage. China being the largest coal consumer played a huge role in global CO2 emissions (as seen from the Choropleth Map above), but a decrease in fossil fuel consumption in 2015 led to a historic decline in coal burning globally, in turn reducing CO2 emissions.",

It utilizes box plots to represent the distribution of emissions data for each year. The median CO2 emissions in 2019 were higher than those in 2020. This indicates that CO2 emissions were lower during the lockdown year on average. The box plots show the range and variability of CO2 emissions within 2019 is wider, meaning there was a larger spread of emissions compared to 2020. The graph suggests that the 2020 lockdown had a noticeable impact on CO2 emissions. The decrease in median emissions and the reduced variability in 2020 reflects the global reduction in economic activity and energy consumption during that period.",

The data for carbon emissions and some of the other fields like air pollution, exports, forest area, fossil fuel energy, GDP, imports are missing for these countries. Notably, these nations exhibit GDPs well under the global median, suggesting limited economic development and industrialization. This economic constraint may hinder their capacity to implement robust data collection and reporting systems. Several small island nations are included in this list, which typically have limited industrial capacity and rely heavily on imported goods, further contributing to their lower GDPs and potentially lower carbon footprints. The lack of consistent data reporting to the UN makes it difficult to accurately assess these countries’ true carbon footprints. Overall, the graph highlights the need for improved data transparency and international cooperation to address climate change, particularly in countries with limited reporting capabilities.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "From this study we analyzed how different factors such as fossil fuel consumption, percentage of forest area, and others affect CO2 emissions worldwide. Using data from the World Bank we were able to analyze country-wise as well as year-wise emissions, making our analysis comprehensive and relevant to understanding how our earth has experienced climate change over the years.\nThese are the main conclusions we have drawn from our analysis:\n\nThe world observes huge global disparities in carbon emissions, with industrialized and manufacturing-heavy nations like China and the US contributing the most, while developing nations contributing much lesser.\nThe continent of Asia has been the highest contributor to global CO2 emissions from 1990-2020.\nFeatures such as GDP and Measure of Exports are closely related to the amount of CO2 emissions for a country.\nA strong positive correlation between trade volume and CO₂ emissions is observed, with exports contributing signficantly more due to energy-intensive processes, while imports show steadier increase in emissions.\nThe Amazon Rainforest has witnessed a devastating decrease in % forest area from the years 1990-2020 ultimately leading to a rise in CO2 emissions.\nAlthough livestock production does contribute to the release of greenhouse gases, CO2 is not a primary pollutant from this activity.\nWhile studying the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, we found a steep drop in both for the year 2015. This is because China decreased their coal consumption in 2015 marking a historic drop in fossil fuel consumption globally!\n\nThe 2020 lockdown reminds us how reduced human activity can rapidly impact the planet, emphasizing the interconnectedness of our actions and the environment. Many countries, especially small island nations, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of increasing carbon emissions, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events. Despite their lower emissions, they may bear the brunt of the climate crisis and might not have the resources to fight due to their already low GDPs. It is imperative to adopt sustainable practices, invest in renewable energy sources, and implement policies that lower carbon emissions. Through collective efforts can we mitigate the impacts of climate change and safeguard the planet for future generations.",
