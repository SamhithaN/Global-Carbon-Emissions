# Conclusion

From this study we analyzed how different factors such as fossil fuel consumption, percentage of forest area, and others affect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide. Using data from the World Bank we were able to analyze country-wise as well as year-wise emissions, making our analysis comprehensive and relevant to understanding how our earth has experienced climate change over the years.

These are the main conclusions we have drawn from our analysis:

- The continent of Asia has been the highest contributor to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 1990-2020.
- Features such as GDP and Measure of Exports are closely related to the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for a country.
- The Amazon Rainforest has witnessed a devastating decrease in % forest area from the years 1990-2020 ultimately leading to a rise in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
- Although livestock production does contribute to the release of greenhouse gases, CO<sub>2</sub> is not a primary pollutant from this activity.
- While studying the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we found a steep drop in both for the year 2015. This is because China decreased their coal consumption in 2015 marking a historic drop in fossil fuel consumption globally!
